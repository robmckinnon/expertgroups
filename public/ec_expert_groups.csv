The project constitutes a highly ambitious, complex and demanding communications project. The success of the project depends upon whether the environment evolves during 2010 and 2011 to become a key tool, used daily to support training and business needs in participating countries.
To ensure its success, the close involvement of national administrations in implementation decisions is essential.
The objective of establishing a TACTIC Implementation Task Force is to ensure the success of the TACTIC project by ensuring close involvement of national administrations in its implementation, thereby ensuring that national needs are addressed in the initial phase of its use by administrations.
Implementation of TACTIC will mean that
1. All tax and customs administrations will
a. have been briefed about TACTIC and had an opportunity to contribute to its design and to its content
b. be able to use the 15 TACTIC functions listed above (on a phased basis during 2010 and 2011)
c. have a named TACTIC contact person from January 2010
2. Policies for use of TACTIC will be established in national administrations during 2010
3. National users are actively using TACTIC in their daily work during 2010
4. Certain work flows will be replaced by new and more efficient work flows via TACTIC functionalities during 2010 and 2011
5. TACTIC is contributing to the incubation and successful completion of new innovations and projects to address common training issues during 2010 and 2011
6. Inter-country exchange about training issues is heightened and increased via TACTIC during 2010 and 2011
The existence of the Task Force is intended to ensure that there are 'Champions' to support a positive change in working practices and the culture of how communications take place between national administrations concerning training issues.","Coordinates with Member States, exchange of views","National Administrations","2010","27 Apr 2011",,"CWG/238",

The work of the High Level Group on Literacy should give visibility and importance to literacy acquisition as part of the key competences for the knowledge society, and should help analysing evidence and mainstreaming the existing good policy practices in a more consistent and systematic way. The group should make succinct proposals to the Commission on ways to improve literacy levels in Member States. The work of the group should reflect the changing nature of reading literacy requirements in the 21st century.
There is a vast amount of knowledge and research on literacy but the challenge is to translate all this knowledge into effective policies.
The High Level Group (HLG) should :
• Analyse existing research, studies and international reports on reading literacy focused on the issues outlined below;
• Examine (through among others an analysis of existing and evaluated programmes and policy initiatives, and through hearings and expert discussions) the most effective and efficient ways of supporting reading literacy in the course of lifelong learning: during pre-school and school education and in the context of adult learning programmes;
• Identify common success factors of literacy programmes (such as UK's Basic Skills programme, the EU-funded ADORE-project);  examine policy examples from countries in which literacy levels are high among young people and adults; and, examine what policy measures have been taken by countries that have been able to improve their performance during successive rounds of the OECD's PISA report which measures literacy skills of students aged 15;
• Translate these common success factors into policy proposals in a succinct report.","Assist the Commission in the preparation of legislation or in policy definition","Public affairs
